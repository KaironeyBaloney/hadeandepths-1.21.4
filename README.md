A Fishing Addon that currently adds **60+ Unique Fish** to spice up vanilla fishing! Catch and butcher new and exotic fish for unique items that can be used in crafting and cooking! The mod also adds:

*   **4** New Fishing Rods!
*   **8** New Tools!
*   **1** New Armor Set!
*   **60+** Fish, categorized by Rarity and Type!
*   **A new Fish Butchering mechanic!**
*   **16** new Food items!

Every fish, treasure, and junk can be found in different biomes, weathers, heights, time of days, etc. so get fishing! The mod features a fully fleshed out advancement progression to help you along your fishing journey.

Here is the (Hopefully Accurate) [Fish, Junk, and Treasure Loot Tables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KIS6Go3KpFgw0oryHcyhUBswDL0cmJ3OGx-xtLAR5tM/edit?usp=sharing) that should give you all the information you need to catch every fish. I'll do my best to upkeep these, but ideally I will integrate an in-game system to resolve the need for this!
